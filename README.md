fpga_digital_watch
==================
A small FPGA project which implement a digital watch. This is my first FPGA project, i do it just for practise verilog language and some basic design methods of FPGA.

There are 3 guidelines in my project:</br>
1. Well designed.</br>
Separating the logic part and driver part, every module should observe SRP and do simple thing. Implementing more complex module by compositon. Making every module general as far as possible.</br>
2. Sufficiently tested.</br>
Every module should have a related test bench. Maybe a little boring and "waste time" at first, but it will be extremly useful in the integration stage.</br>
3. Use FSM as far as possible.</br>
Don't be afraid that FSM is overused, because the worst thing is we could not use FSM. Practice makes perfect!</br>

PS. Writing english is harder than writing code for me because of my poor english. :P
